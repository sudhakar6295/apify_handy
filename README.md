## Getting started

For complete information [see this article](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development#build-actor-at-apify-console). In short, you will:

1. Build the Actor
2. Run the Actor

## Pull the Actor for local development

If you would like to develop locally, you can pull the existing Actor from Apify console using Apify CLI:

1. Install `apify-cli`

    **Using Homebrew**

    ```bash
    brew install apify-cli
    ```

    **Using NPM**

    ```bash
    npm -g install apify-cli
    ```

2. Pull the Actor by its unique `<ActorId>`, which is one of the following:
    - unique name of the Actor to pull (e.g. "apify/hello-world")
    - or ID of the Actor to pull (e.g. "E2jjCZBezvAZnX8Rb")

    You can find both by clicking on the Actor title at the top of the page, which will open a modal containing both Actor unique name and Actor ID.

    This command will copy the Actor into the current directory on your local machine.

    ```bash
    apify pull <ActorId>
    ```
